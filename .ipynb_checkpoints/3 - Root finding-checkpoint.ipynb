    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem encountered in engineering analysis is as follows: Given a function $f(x)$, determine the values of $x$ for which $f(x) = 0$. The solutions (values of $x$) are known as the *roots* of the equation $f(x) = 0$, or the *zeroes* of the function $f(x)$. Almost *any* equation that requires solving can be written this way by moving the terms on the right hand side of the equation to the left hand side.\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods of finding roots are iterative procedures that require a starting point (i.e., an estimate of the root). This estimate is crucial; a bad starting value may fail to converge, or it may converge to the \"wrong\" root (a root different from the one sought). It is highly advisable to go a step further and *bracket* the root (determine its lower and upper bounds) before passing the problem to a root-finding algorithm."

    "### Incremental Search Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind the incremental search method is simple: If $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have opposite signs, then there is at least one root in the interval $(x_1, x_2)$. If the interval is small enough, it is likely to contain a single root. Thus the zeros of $f(x)$ can be detected by evaluating the function at intervals $\\Delta x$ and looking for a change in sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several potential problems with the incremental search method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is possible to miss two closely spaced roots if the search increment $\\Delta x$ is larger than the spacing of the roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A double root (two roots that coincide) will not be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Certain singularities (poles) of $f(x)$ can be mistaken for roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you find a generator function `rootsearch` that divides an interval $(a, b)$ into `steps` equal intervals and then sequentially returns the intervals for which the function values of a function `f` brackets a root based on a change in sign of the function."

    "### Method of Bisection\n",
    "\n",
    "After a root of $f(x) = 0$ has been bracketed in the interval $(x_1, x_2)$, several methods can be used to close in on it. The [method of bisection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method) accomplishes this by successively halving the interval until it becomes sufficiently small. Once a root has been bracketed, bisection will always close in on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of bisection uses the same principle as incremental search: If there is a root in the interval $(x_1, x_2)$, then $f(x_1)$ and $f(x_2)$ have opposite signs. To halve the interval, we compute $f(x_3)$, where $x_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1+x_2)$ is the midpoint of the interval. If $f(x_2)$ and $f(x_3)$ have opposite signs, then the root must be in $(x_3, x_2)$, and we record this by replacing the original bound $x_1$ by $x_3$. Otherwise, the root lies in $(x_1, x_3)$, in which case $x_2$ is replaced by $x_3$. In either case, the new interval $(x_1, x_2)$ is half the size of the original interval. The bisection is repeated until the interval has been reduced to a small value $\\varepsilon$, so that $\\left| x_2âˆ’x_1 \\right| \\leq \\varepsilon$.\n",
