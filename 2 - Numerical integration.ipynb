    "Implement a function `romberg()` that performs Romberg integration until a tolerance `tol` is achieved. Note that the most accurate estimate of the integral is always the last diagonal term of the array, so the process needs to be continued until the difference between two successive diagonal terms $|R_{i,i} - R_{i-1,i-1}| < \\text{tol}$. Although the triangular array is convenient for hand computations, computer implementation of the Romberg algorithm can be carried out within a one-dimensional array $\\boldsymbol{r}$ (i.e. a list or a vector) that contains a diagonal row of the array $R_{i, :}$ at any time."
